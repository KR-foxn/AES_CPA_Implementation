CPA(Correlation Power Analysis)
  -Power analysis attacks consume power/electromagnetic waves according to the calculated data value and calculation code value inside the equipment, and typically rely on the Hamming weight of the data to consume power/electromagnetic waves.
  -CPA is a method of guessing the key by obtaining the correlation coefficient.
  -The power consumption is proportional to the number of 1 in the intermediate value of the operation.
  -If the key guess is correct, the correlation coefficient is high.
